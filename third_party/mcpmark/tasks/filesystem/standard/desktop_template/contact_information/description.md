### Task Description

Your task is to compile all contact information from all the files into a single CSV table. You need to extract all people's contact information and organize it systematically.

### Task Objectives

   - First column: Name (required)
   - Second column: Email (required)
   - Third column: Phone (required)
   - Additional columns: Any other contact information types found
5. **Consolidate information** by merging the same types of information across entries into single columns
6. **Leave cells blank** if specific information is not available for a person/organization
7. Each entry from different files should be processed and listed separately, without any secondary processing.

### Expected Output
