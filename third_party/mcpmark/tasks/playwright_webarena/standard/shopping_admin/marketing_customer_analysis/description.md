Perform a comprehensive marketing and customer analysis workflow in the Magento Admin panel to understand search behavior patterns and promotional effectiveness.

**Task Requirements:**

1. First, we need to access the system to begin our comprehensive analysis:
   if need to login, login with username 'admin' and password 'admin1234'

2. Let's start by analyzing customer search behavior to understand what customers are looking for:
   Go to Search Terms in Reports and analyze the search data:
   - Identify the TOP 2 search terms with the highest number of hits (record exact terms and hit counts)
   - Find a search term that has 0 results but still has search hits (record exact term and hit count)
   - Count the total number of search terms displayed in the report

3. Next, we'll examine our promotional strategies to understand current marketing efforts:
   Navigate to Cart Price Rules and identify:
   - Find ALL rules that contain a coupon code
   - Record the exact coupon codes and the complete rule names for each
   - Count how many active rules exist in total

4. Now let's analyze our email marketing reach and subscriber engagement:
   Go to Newsletter Subscribers:
   - Apply filter to show only 'Subscribed' status
   - Count the total number of subscribed users showing after filter
   - Verify whether these TWO emails appear in the subscribed list:
     * john.smith.xyz@gmail.com
     * admin@magento.com

5. To support our analysis, we need to create test customer profiles for different segments:
   Create TWO new customers with the following details:
   
   Customer 1:
   - First Name: Marketing1
   - Last Name: Analy
   - Email: marketdata1.analysis@magento.com
   - Associate to Website: Main Website
   - Group: General
   
   Customer 2:
   - First Name: Analytics1
   - Last Name: Report
   - Email: analytics1.report@magento.com
   - Associate to Website: Main Website
   - Group: Wholesale

6. Finally, let's review overall business performance metrics from the main dashboard:
   Go to Dashboard and identify:
   - Among the products tied for the highest sales quantity in the Bestsellers table, identify the one with the highest price - record its name and sales quantity
   - The total revenue displayed on the dashboard

7. Compile all your findings and must output them in the following exact format at last:

```

Top2SearchTerms|term1:hits1,term2:hits2
ZeroResultTerm|term:hits
TotalSearchTerms|count
