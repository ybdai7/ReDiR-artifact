Fix the customer analysis query that is producing incorrect results.

## Background

The data analytics team attempted to create a customer behavior analysis query to identify active customers and analyze their spending patterns and preferences. The requirements are:
- Only count rentals that have associated payment records (paid rentals)
- Only include customers with at least 15 paid rentals
- Only include customers with valid email addresses

However, they're getting incorrect results - the query is over-counting rentals and calculating wrong spending amounts. 

Your task is to fix this query to produce accurate results.

## The Problematic Query

Here's the buggy query that needs to be fixed:

```sql
WITH customer_basic_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as customer_name,

        co.country as customer_country,
        COUNT(r.rental_id) as total_rentals,
        COUNT(DISTINCT i.film_id) as unique_films,
        SUM(p.amount) as total_spent,
        AVG(EXTRACT(days FROM (r.return_date - r.rental_date))) as avg_rental_duration
    FROM customer c
    JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id

    cbs.avg_rental_duration,
    CASE 
        WHEN cbs.total_spent >= 150 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN cbs.total_spent >= 75 THEN 'Standard'
        ELSE 'Basic'
    END as customer_tier,
    rpf.title as most_popular_film_in_region,
    rpf.rental_count as regional_film_rental_count

```

## Known Issues

When comparing the problematic query results with the expected correct values, the following discrepancies are observed:

1. **Rental count discrepancies**: Many customers show higher `total_rentals` counts than expected

2. **Spending amount errors**: The `total_spent` values don't match the correct calculations 

3. **Incorrect favorite categories and actors**: Many customers show wrong favorite categories and actors compared to the expected results

4. **Time calculation inconsistencies**: The `avg_rental_duration` values differ significantly from the correct calculations
    - Example: Customer ID 1 shows 3.90 days instead of the expected 4.27 days
    - Example: Customer ID 2 shows 5.23 days instead of the expected 5.69 days

## Your Task

Debug and fix the query to produce accurate results. Then create a table with your corrected results.

1. **Fix the query** to ensure:
   - Accurate customer spending and rental counts
   - Correct favorite categories and actors
   - Proper regional popular films

2. **Create a table** called `customer_analysis_fixed` in the `public` schema with your corrected query results. The table should have the same columns as the original query output.

**Important**: The business logic and output columns should remain the same - only fix the data accuracy issues.

**Note on payments**: A rental's revenue is determined by the rental itself — every payment recorded against a rental counts toward the customer who made that rental, regardless of which `customer_id` happens to appear on the payment row.
